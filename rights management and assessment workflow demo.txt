
- Hi Guys,
In Continuation of privacy smarthub  demo, today we will have demo for  Rights Management and Assessment Workflow:

Let's start with the Rights Management:

- Under Rights management
Users with various persona such as Employee, ex-Employee, Vendor, Visitor, etc. Can utilize the tool to access and manage their rights as listed under GDPR or CCP.

- So, by selecting the regulation and data subject location, we will get the list of rights availble to the user.

Now user can slect any rights from the list and raise a request by selecting appropriate statement and the reason.

 
 After successfull submission of the request, the data subject will get a confirmation link on his/her email. He need to confirm his/her request by clciking on the link. The status of the request will be initiated state.
 
 
                The request riased here can be seen under Inventory->Rights Management(DSAR) and will be visible to DPO Admin
					 - Now it will be DPO admin responsibility to either acknowledge/reject the request
					 - upon acknowledgement, the request will be assigned to specific business owner based on pre-configured business matrix
					 - Now it will be the responsibility of business owner to either fullfilled/partially fullfilled or reject the request. it will be in Request Resolutions state.
					 - Lastly the DPO admin will have the responsibility of either closing the request or sent it back to business owner.
					
					

 Now, We will go through the assessment workflow in Privacy smarthub.

- To be compliant with privacy regulations, the assessment plays a vital role. We have different  assessment types like PIA, DPIA, ROPA, DATA BREACH Report.

- In our privacy smarthub, the assessment can be achieved through different moddules developed, we have template module for creating a template(basically a configuration of questionnaire related to data privacy).
- Then we have lauch assessment functionality for assigning the published template to respondents. Here the respondent will have the opportunity to complete the assessment and the reviewer will have the opportunity to review the assessment and give his feedback.

- Then we have risk evaluation and risk mitigation functionality under risk inventory component.

Now we will look into these component one by one.

So let us start with Template Creation..

- In template creation we have three section 1) Template Name Configuration 2) Questionnaire configuration and 3) Rule configuration. (In rule configuration, basically we are raising risk to a question in advance)
