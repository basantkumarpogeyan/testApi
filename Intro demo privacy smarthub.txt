Intro:

Privacy smarthub is a solution proposed by LTIMindtree to mange the different privacy and regulatory compliance across the countries.
The tool comes with pre-baked regulations and check list with purposed solutions, which helps in maintaining the compliance.

	                           Data Discovery

The first use case or feature of Privacy Smarthub is data Discovery.
Privacy Smart Up comes with 90+ preconfigured data elements allowing user to fine tune the selections of data element based on business verticals like banking and finance, medical and healthcare, media, entertainment, insurance, automobile, etc.Privacy Smart Up supports discovery for both structured and unstructured data. The highlighting feature here includes that Privacy Smartup takes care of both metadata as well as the actual sensitive data while performing discovery.
- For metadata privacy, Smartup uses keywords and patterns.
-For actual sensitive data, we are using discovery techniques including pattern matching, ML model algorithm, master data and custom code.
- Upon having the satisfactory configuration and selection of the data element, the user can then go ahead and scan the data source that he wants to.

				  Data Protection

Moving on to the next use case which is Data Protection.
Smarthub offers various masking rules depending on the source we are planning to mask. For structured sources, the tool offers 2 types of masking rules, Static masking and Dynamic masking.
Upon selecting static masking as a masking rule, the user can see a preconfigured masking template where each data element is mapped to a masking technique utilizing the inventory.
Dynamic masking is another masking rule provided by Privacymartup which uses the native capability of sources like MSSQL, Snowflake, Postgres etc.

				 Rights Management

Moving on to the next use case, that is Data Subject Rights Management.
User with various persona such as Employee, ex, Employee, Vendor, Visitor, etc. Can utilize the tool to access their rights as listed under GDPR or CCP.
The user can submit the request which will be visible under the Inventory section of Rights Management for a DPO Admin persona.

Upon acknowledging the request by DPO , it will be forwarded to a business owner based on a pre configured decision matrix and the business owner will take necessary steps in order to either close or even reject the request to access the right that has been raised by data subject.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				 Assessment Workflow

The next use case that we are going to talk about is called Assessment Workflow,
 which includes features such as PIA , ROPA, Data Protection Impact Analysis(DPIA), Data Breach Report and Privacy by Design.
Assessment Workflow can be further broken down into three sections, the first being creating a Questionnaire or a Template, the second being launching an Assessment and finally being identifying and managing risks.

- After creating template, you can publish the template in order to have it available to be launched as a questionnaire and assign it to any respondent and reviewer under privacyhub section.

- For a respondent, the assessment can be visible under Inventory section where they can visit the assessment and upon clicking on the necessary assessment they can actually answer the questionnaire that you have set up.

- After the respondent has submitted the necessary response, a reviewer or an approver can go to the inventory section and select the assessment that needs to be reviewed.

- Now, as a reviewer, we can either raise a risk from the library or create a new risk in order to highlight the given response is not in compliance to expected behavior of this assessment.


- The risk raised will be visible under risk inventory, which can then be modulated by planning the mitigation of the risk, by having the risk owner comment, by having the risk reviewer comment and by finally assessing whether the risk has been residue or not.
