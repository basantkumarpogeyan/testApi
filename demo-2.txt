In Continuation of privacy smarthub  demo, today we will have privacy smart hub demo part-2

- We will go through the assessment workflow in Privacy smarthub.

- To be compliant with privacy regulations, the assessment plays a vital role. We have different  assessment types like PIA, DPIA, ROPA, DATA BREACH Report.

- In our privacy smarthub, the assessment can be achieved through different moddules developed, we have template module for creating a template(basically a configuration of questionnaire related to data privacy).
- Then we have lauch assessment functionality for assigning the published template to respondents. Here the respondent will have the opportunity to complete the assessment and the reviewer will have the opportunity to review the assessment and give his feedback.

- Then we have risk evaluation and risk mitigation functionality under risk inventory component.

Now we will look into these component one by one.

So let us start with Template Creation..

- In template creation we have three section 1) Template Name Configuration 2) Questionnaire configuration and 3) Rule configuration. (In rule configuration, basically we are raising risk to a question in advance)
